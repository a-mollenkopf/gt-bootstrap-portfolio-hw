                                        I was born in Suwanee, Georgia and lived there until I was about
                                        5. We then moved to Florida and we lived there until I was about
                                        10. After Florida we moved to Calfornia for only a year and ended
                                        up coming back to Georgia. Since we've been back, we have moved
                                        around a couple of times and are currently in Alpharetta. I have
                                        most recently worked in retail and mostly reatil throughout my
                                        career. I was a piercer at a tattoo shop for a little bit but
                                        decided it just wasn't for me. I decided I wanted to do something
                                        meaningful with my life and put myself into a better career so I
                                        ended up in Georgia Tech's Fullstack Bootcamp. It has honestly
                                        been the best decision I have ever made. I love programming and I
                                        always have. My father is also a programmer and he used to show me
                                        all kinds of stuff when I was younger, and I am pretty much my
                                        father down to a T.
