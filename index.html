          <p>
            I was born in Suwanee, Georgia and lived there until I was about 5.
            We then moved to Florida and we lived there until I was about 10.
            After Florida, we moved to California for only a year and ended up
            coming back to Georgia. Since we've been back, we have moved around
            a couple more times and are currently in Alpharetta. I have most
            recently worked in retail and mostly retail throughout my career. I
            was a piercer at a tattoo shop for a little bit but decided it just
            wasn't for me. I decided I wanted to do something meaningful with my
            life and put myself into a better career, so I ended up in Georgia
            Tech's Fullstack Bootcamp. It has honestly been the best decision I
            have ever made. I love programming and I always have. My father is
            also a programmer and he used to show me all kinds of stuff when I
            was younger, and I am pretty much my father down to a T. So far I
            have learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, and also how
            to make API calls.It has definitely been a rough three weeks trying
            to learn everything that goes into each. Javascript was by far the
            hardest one for me, so I'm thankful we moved on to jQuery. API calls
            have also been kind of a hard one for me, but I'm slowly getting the
            hang of it. I absolutely love HTML and CSS the best by far. I've
            always been about design and layouts. I have been drawing all of my
            life so of course that part came easy to me. I'm super excited to
            move on and learn even more languages. A couple of hobbies of mine
            include hiking with my dogs, going to the lake, and drawing. I have
            two dogs currently; a pitbull named Arkham and a border collie mix
            named Chloe. We actually rescued Chloe when we were visiting in
            colorado for the week. We decided it would be a better trip if we
            had a dog and it ended up being a split second decision, and it's
            honestly been one of the best decisions I've made so far.
