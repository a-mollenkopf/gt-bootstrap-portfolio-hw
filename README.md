# Features

Working on this page helped me to further my knowledge of CSS styling as well as bootstrap to layout a basic webpage. I learned how to add in media queries to make the page mobile responsive as well as learning a little bit more about padding, margins, and widths. I learned how to properly space pictures out and space containers the way I wanted to using padding and margins. I really liked building this website beacuse it was a serious challenge. I got it as close to the examples as possible and I feel very good with how it turned out.
